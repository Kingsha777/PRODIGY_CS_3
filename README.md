# PASS-CHECK

## Introduction

**PASS-CHECKER** is a simple Python script designed to assess the complexity of a given password. It evaluates the password based on specific criteria, including length, the use of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The script then classifies the password as **Weak**, **Moderate**, or **Strong**.

## Features

- **Length Check**: Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.
- **Character Diversity**: Checks for the inclusion of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- **Complexity Rating**: Provides a rating of the password's complexity (Weak, Moderate, Strong).
