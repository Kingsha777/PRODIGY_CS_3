# PASS-CHECK

## Introduction

**PASS-CHECKER** is a simple Python script designed to assess the complexity of a given password. It evaluates the password based on specific criteria, including length, the use of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The script then classifies the password as **Weak**, **Moderate**, or **Strong**.

## Features
